# Silent-Interface-for-IOT-Devices

The surface electromyography (sEMG) signals, during the silent speech, are recorded from the facial muscles of a speaker using
8-channel gold cup electrodes and filtered to remove noise and other unwanted signals. The spectrogram of the
processed signal is then extracted to train a Convolution Neural Network (CNN). The trained model is finally
deployed to predict the utterances.
